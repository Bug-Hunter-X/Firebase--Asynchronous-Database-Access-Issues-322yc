This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Realtime Database interactions: attempting database operations before the connection is fully established. The `bug.js` file shows code that leads to unpredictable behavior due to premature database access.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version utilizing the `.on('value', ...)` method and promises to ensure the database is ready before accessing data.
